  ## Description

The purpose of this project was to combine the principals of MySQL and Node.js to create an application that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with a database. This command-line application allows business owners to view and manage company departments, roles, and employees. During the development process, I became comfortable utilizing MySQL syntax and incorporating it into a JavaScript application.
